# RGB-LWIR_YOLOv7_training_testing
The first notebook (RGB-LWIR_image_processor) is used to generate additional edge-defined images from an original image dataset. The notebook is currently set to generate six image processed images. 

The second notebook (YOLOv7_train_test) is used to train and test YOLOv7 object detection models. Use the test_yaml and test.py files when testing images and labels to generate mAP. Upload the test_yaml to the data folder within the YOLOv7 folder. Add the test.py script into the main YOLOv7 folder.
